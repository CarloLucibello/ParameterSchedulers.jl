[{"body":"ParameterSchedulers Dev Build Status ParameterSchedulers . jl provides common machine learning (ML) schedulers for hyper - parameters .  Though this package is framework agnostic, a convenient interface for pairing schedules with  Flux . jl  optimizers is available .  Using this package with Flux is as simple as:","id":"README.html#parameterschedulers"},{"body":"Available Schedules This is a table of the common schedules implemented, but ParameterSchedulers provides utilities for creating more exotic schedules as well . Step(;λ, γ, step_sizes) Exponential decay by  γ  every step in  step_sizes Exp(;λ, γ) Exponential decay by  γ  every iteration Poly(;λ, p, max_iter) Polynomial decay at degree  p Inv(;λ, γ, p) Inverse decay at rate  (1 + tγ)^p Tri(;λ0, λ1, period) Triangle wave  function TriDecay2(;λ0, λ1, period) Triangle wave  function with half the amplitude every  period TriExp(;λ0, λ1, period, γ) Triangle wave  function with exponential amplitude decay at rate  γ","id":"README.html#available-schedules"}]
